# Codebook for the *"data_tidy.txt"* Output Generated by the "run_analysis.R" Script
### Author: Eric W Bucholz

This codebook contains descriptions of the general contents of the Human Activity Recognition Data used here, the analyses performed to generate a tidy data set, the variables included in the tidy data set, and the summary of the contents of the tidy data set.  

## How to View the Contents of *"data_tidy.txt"*
The file *"data_tidy.txt"* was generated using the write.table)() function and has dimensions 180 rows by 68 columns.  
It can be viewed in R with the following commands:  

    data <- read.table("data_tidy.txt", header = TRUE)
    View(data)

## Brief Overview of the Human Activity Recognition Data

The Human Activity Recognition data (contained in the zipped file https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) represents experiments that were carried out with 30 study participants aged 19 to 48 years. Each of the study participants performed six activities (laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking downstairs, and walking upstairs) while were a Samsung Galaxy S II on his/her waist. From the phone's internal accelerometer and gyroscope, the experimenters captuered 3-axial linear acceleration and angular velocity data. The data obtained from these measurements were divided into test and training data in which the data was randomly divided into 30% and 70% of the volunteers, respectively.

The 3-axial accelerometer and gyroscope measurements were divided into corresponding body movement, body jerk, and gravity measurements; this data was subsequently divided in time domain signals and frequency domain signals. The frequency domain signals were obtained by applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of the signals.  

The following functions were applied to the data measurements: 

Function | Description
-------- | -----------
mean() | Average value
std() | Standard deviation
mad() | Median absolute deviation
max() | Maximum value
min() | Minimum value
energy() | Measure of energy
iqr() | Interquartile range
entropy() | Signal entropy
arCoeff() | Autoregression coefficients with Burg order of 4
correlation() | Correlation coefficient between 2 signals
maxInds() | Index of the frequency component with the largest magnitude
meanFreq() | Mean frequency from a weighted average of the frequency components 
skewness() | Skewness of the frequency domain signal
kurtosis() | Kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
bandsEnergy() | Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window
angle() | Angle between 2 vectors

These functions provide an overall data set of 561 different variables for each of the 30 study participants and 6 activities being measured.

## Generation of *"data_tidy.txt"*
Each column in *"data_tidy.txt"*  represents a single variable measured in the Human Activity Recognition study, and each row in *"data_tidy.txt"* represents the average measurement for a given subject participant and activity being performed.  

Specifically, the data contains average values for all of the variables in the study that represent mean and standard deviation values. As such, the only variables included in this study are variables that included the use of the mean() and std() functions in their given names.
